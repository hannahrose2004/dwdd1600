        <h1>Declaration of Independance</h1>
        <h2>What it says</h2>
        <p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their
            Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, <strong>Liberty</strong> and the pursuit
            of
            Happiness.--That to <em>secure</em> these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just
            powers
            from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends,
            it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its
            foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to
            effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should
            not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are
            more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to
            which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same
            Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty.</p>
        <p>He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their
            operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to
            them.</p>

        <h2>Why we are upset</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.</li>
            <li>He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.</li>

        </ol>
